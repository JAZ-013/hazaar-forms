# Introduction

Forms are handled by a controller.  This controller takes care of all communication between the browser and the server application and when needed, calls internal actions to handle certain aspects such as saving and loading form data.  By default, minimal code is required to get up and running with only a few more lines required to be able to save and load form data.
